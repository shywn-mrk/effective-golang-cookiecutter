# Configuration

Configuration files are located in the `config/` directory:
- `config.go`: Go configuration logic
- `config.yaml`: YAML configuration for environment variables and settings

You can customize these files to fit your application's needs. The template supports environment-based configuration and can be extended for secrets management.
